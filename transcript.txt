Good morning, everyone. Let's get started. The main goals today are to review the current sprint progress, address any blockers, and prep for the next release.
Morning! On the engineering side, we’ve completed 80% of the tasks for Sprint 14. The new data export feature is implemented but needs additional testing for edge cases.
Yeah, I noticed a couple of issues with exporting large files. The app slows down noticeably. We’ll need to profile performance and possibly optimize the export logic.
Thanks. Can your team handle performance optimization by Thursday?
Should be doable. I'll assign it to Emily and check in with her after this call.
Quick update on my end: the new dashboard design is finalized and ready for handoff. I’ll upload the Figma files by noon today.
Great. Could you also include mobile mockups in that upload?
Yes, I'll include those too.
One more thing – we're missing unit tests for the new user onboarding flow. Can that be added before the QA pass?
Good catch. I'll add those to our checklist and assign someone today.
Perfect. Let's aim to freeze features by end of day Friday. Any other concerns?
No, all good.
Nothing from me.
Same here.
Awesome. I'll share meeting notes and updated sprint board after the call. Thanks, everyone!
