Sarah: Alright, good morning everyone. Let’s get started. We’ve got a packed agenda today — the goal is to align on Q3 objectives, look back at what went well in Q2, and dig into any blockers in product, engineering, and operations. We’ll kick off with some updates from the exec team. Please hold questions until each section is done.
Martin: Thanks Sarah. So yeah, overall, Q2 was strong. We saw about a 17% increase in user retention, and that was mostly thanks to the new onboarding flow and the in-app guidance that went live back in May. Revenue also went up — about 12% quarter over quarter. Churn ticked down a bit too, from 3.2 to 2.9 percent. So some solid improvements. With the Series C raise now complete, we’ve got more flexibility to double down on R&D and customer success, but we still need to be smart — hiring has to stay disciplined and we need to get a handle on the cloud spend.
Rachel: Yep, echoing that — the budget runway is healthy, around 24 months at our current burn. But we did spot a couple areas where we’re not super efficient. AWS costs in particular jumped 22% last quarter, and some of that is coming from idle resources and lack of automated scaling. We’ll be sharing a breakdown — service by service — so engineering and DevOps can work on trimming some of that waste.
Anjali: Definitely on our radar. We’ve already started tweaking autoscaling policies with the platform team — we’re now basing it on both CPU and network thresholds. Roadmap-wise, we shipped 3 out of 5 planned features. Two didn’t make it: the sentiment clustering and the deduplication engine. Those will roll into Q3. But the new embeddings service went live, and it’s already powering smart search for the beta users.
Laura: Yeah, on the product side — smart search beta launched to about 1,300 power users. Feedback has been rolling in — we got over 400 responses so far, and about 78% are positive. Top request we’re seeing: people want better filters — like time ranges and doc types. Q3 focus for us is to get deduplication wrapped up by mid-August, finish clustering, and start exploring mobile push notifications and content digests. Also, customers are really asking for analytics dashboards — especially in the enterprise space.
David: Exactly — we ran about a dozen discovery interviews with enterprise users, and they really want to see engagement metrics: like who’s reading what content, how long they’re spending in the doc viewer, how it’s trending over time. So we’re aiming for an alpha version of that analytics dashboard in September, but we’ll need close coordination with frontend and design for the visual side.
Julia: Engineering-wise — the new embeddings service is stable, and performance has improved across the board. Latency is down 40%, and the infra team kept it running at 99.99% uptime. Frontend and backend teams worked together to optimize the document viewer — rendering is about 18% faster now. One big win was refactoring the access control system to support RBAC, which unblocks a lot of upcoming enterprise deals. We also finally sunset the v1 APIs — big effort, but glad that’s behind us.
Leo: Just to add to that — on the platform side, we rolled out a new autoscaling policy in staging. It’s working well, using both CPU and network thresholds. We’re seeing about 22% cost savings during off-peak times. If all goes well, we’ll push that to production in two weeks. Also, we found a bunch of orphaned EBS volumes and idle GPU instances — already starting to clean those up.
Priya: Over in ML land, we trained a new summarization model — version 3.2 — using over 20 million documents. The ROUGE score went up by 14 points, and we’re seeing fewer hallucinations. This is the model behind the new beta auto-summary feature. We’re also experimenting with zero-shot classification to predict customer intent. Right now the F1 is sitting at 0.81, so promising early results. For Q3, we’re focused on finalizing clustering, improving multilingual topic detection, and testing real-time summarization — especially for meeting transcripts like this one.
Lena: From Customer Success — NPS jumped up to 46, which is great. Last quarter it was 39. Customers are loving the onboarding flow and the new help center articles. We rolled out live chat for enterprise users — and that’s already cut our average resolution time by 38%. In Q3 we’re piloting account health dashboards to help CSMs predict churn earlier. Also hiring two more CSMs — enterprise is growing fast. One issue we’re still seeing is low feature discovery — lots of users don’t even realize some tools exist. We need better walkthroughs, tooltips, and onboarding emails.
Jon: Support handled 2,100 tickets last quarter, with 92% CSAT. Top issues: confusion around permissions and some odd edge cases in search. Engineering has been super helpful debugging search bugs. We’re also building internal tools to let us reproduce user sessions more accurately.
Karen: Sales had a solid quarter — we beat our bookings target by 9%. That new pricing page really helped — self-serve signups jumped 27%. On the enterprise side, we renewed 6 contracts and upsold 3. Common requests are exportable reports, deeper analytics, and better SSO options. Q3 focus: we’re doing a webinar series, updating the pitch deck, and starting targeted campaigns for verticals like legal and consulting.
Ethan: Marketing — SEO traffic is up 12% MoM. Newsletter open rates are holding steady, and click-through rate is at 6.3%. LinkedIn ads were kind of a miss last month — we’re rotating in new creatives next week to try some different value props. Also exploring video snippets for product education.
Mira: On the legal side, we had a clean SOC 2 renewal — no exceptions found, so that’s great news. We are keeping an eye on the new EU AI regulations — they might impact how we handle personally identifiable information during model training. We’ll need to coordinate with ML and product on anonymization pipelines and clear opt-out flows.
Sarah: Alright, thanks everyone. To wrap up, we’ve got a few key action items: engineering will finish deduplication and get autoscaling to prod, product will deliver analytics alpha and finalize clustering, ML will launch summarization v3.2 and continue topic detection, and support and success will focus on onboarding and account health. Sales and marketing will double down on vertical targeting and webinars. Please update your team OKRs by end of week and link them in Notion. We'll reconvene mid-August for a checkpoint. Any final thoughts?
Martin: Just — really strong work across the board. Let’s keep it going in Q3.
